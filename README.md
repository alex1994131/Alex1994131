Hi, I'm [Alex Liu](), a passionate self-taught Full Stack web, mobile and blockchain developer from England. My passion for software lies with dreaming up ideas and making them come true with elegant interfaces. I take great care in the experience, architecture, and code quality of the things I build.

I am also an open-source enthusiast and maintainer. I learned a lot from the open-source community and I love how collaboration and knowledge sharing happened through open-source.

- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything, I am happy to help;
